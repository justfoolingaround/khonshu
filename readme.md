This project is a collection of tools that may be the barebone of a malicious projects.

- Information Extraction

    These **only** work on Windows. However, this does not, in any way, mean that implementations for other OS cannot be made.

## Utility

The utilities in thie project may be used by non-malicious projects to gain what could be a protected information within in a system. This may include some of the following:

- [Cloudflare bypass using user's cookie.](./cloudflare_bypass.py)
- Transfer of browser storage from old to new browser.
- Extracting credentials for using in own or trusted projects.
- Remotely extracting information from a system.

## The main point

This project mainly shows you how simple it is to gain critical information from a system, even without privileged access.

This means that simply not handing `sudo` or Administrator privileges to a malicious script does not protect your device. A simple accidental run can export nearly all information available.

The ultimate method of protection is common sense.
